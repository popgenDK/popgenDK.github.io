# Content

The course is a comprehensive introduction to a number of topics and common research tools used in analyses of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. Topics include: genetic drift, natural selection, population structure, recent and ancient admixture, spatial genetics, f-statistics and demographic inference and simulations. We will cover the theoretical concepts but the main focus is practical use of the methods. Lectures will be combined with hands-on computer exercises.

## Intended Learning Outcome

After the course the student should be able to:

- Use population genetic theory to infer basic population genetics characteristics from genetic data
- Be able to infer ancestry and population structure based on genetic data
- Use NGS data including low depth for population genetic inference.
- Select the optimal strategy for selection scans depending on the population genetics characteristics of the sample population, including taking population structure into account
- Interpret and discuss the results of own analyses and results in the scientific literature

## Time and place

The course will take place from Monday August 7 to Friday August 11th 2023 at Biocenteret, Ole Maaloes Vej 5, 2200 Copenhagen N. All lectures and computer exercises will take place in room 4.0.24 (i.e. building 4, ground floor, room number 24). This includes research talks. You can enter the buiding from two sides as shown shown on this map.
Laptop

You should bring a laptop to the course. We will log into a remote server from the laptop so any laptop will do regardless of operating system.
Course material

The lecture will be based on a large amount of reading material (articles/notes) that should be read in advance - you can find them here once they are finalized (you will get an email with password). The slides used during the lectures will be made available right before the lectures.

## Evaluation

Participants who have participated actively in all parts of the course and completed all exercises satisfactorily will be awarded a certificate of completion at the end of the course. The work load corresponds to 5 ECTS points. Note that this workload includes one week of preparation. Reading material for this is available in the above course program. The online participants of the course will not recieve the ECTS points but will still recieve a diploma.
